Design  Decisions
ALl user stories are assumed that they have a jira ticket as below
User Story -1 :   DTPZN-1
User Story -2 :   DTPZN-2
User Story -3 :   DTPZN-3
User Story -4 :   DTPZN-4

Each API dedicated for a user story will contain both part-1 and part-2 of the user story
User Story -1 (GET API-"/books")
Library will always show books those are not assigned to any user.
User Story -2 (GET API-"/borrow/{user_id}/{book_id}")
When user borrows a book, then user is added to the book and removing the book from the library,is achieved by not showing any user assigned books in the list of all available books.
So, the book will be always there in the database , but view books will show all available books to borrow.
User Story -3 (GET API-"/borrow_copy/{user_id}/{isbn}")
same assumption like user story 2, about removing a book from library, plus copies of books are stored by introducing ISBN , all copies will have same ISBN .
User Story -4 (POST API- "/return_books/{user_id}")
same assumption like user story 2, about removing a book from library.
